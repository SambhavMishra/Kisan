Potato Disease Information

Early Blight

Common Name
Early Blight 
	
Scientific Name
Alternaria solani

Impact 
Between crops, the early blight fungus can overwinter on potato refuse in the field, in soil, on tubers, and on other solanaceous plants. Infection occurs when spores of the fungus come in contact with susceptible leaves and sufficient free moisture is present. Spore germination and infection are favored by warm weather and wet conditions from dew, rain, or sprinkler irrigation. Alternately, wet and dry periods with relatively dry, windy conditions favor spore dispersal and disease spread. Tubers can be infected as they are lifted through the soil at harvest. If sufficient moisture is present, spores germinate and infect the tubers.


Management
Disease free seed tubers should be used for planting.
Removal and destruction of infected plant debris should be done because the spores lying in the soil are the primary source of infection.
Very early spraying with Zineb or captan 0.2% and repeating it for every 15 â€“ 20 days gives effective control.
The variety Kufri Sindhuri possesses a fair degree of resistance.
